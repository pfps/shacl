		Implementing SHACL as a translation to SPARQL

I updated my older implementation of SHACL to my new syntax proposal and
added the missing pieces.  This implementation is a pure translation to
SPARQL - the validation results of a SHACL shape are the elements of the
result set returned by a SPARQL query against an RDF graph.  The
implementation cannot depend on pre-binding in the data graph or hasShape or
anything that is not in SPARQL.  The implementation also does not depend on
access to the shapes graph during the execution of the SPARQL queries.


	Implementation Basics

The queries that implement shape validation need an environment where the
main variable (always ?this) will include the nodes in the data graph that
need to be validated.  This is easy for the initial shape (the one that
works on the results of scopes) but not so easy for embedded shapes.

To ensure that embedded shapes work correctly they use a graph pattern that
correctly generates bindings for ?this.  For example, inside a construct
that is looking at the values of a path the pattern will bind ?this to these
values.

However, this is not quite sufficient for constructs (like minCount) that
need to look at a set of values as an entirety.  If there are no values for
?this then there are no bindings and thus nothing to work with in SPARQL.
To get around this problem, the graph pattern thus does not just generate
bindings for ?this but bindings for ?this related to another node, which is
the binding for ?parent, or related to the graph as a whole, in which case
there is no ?parent variable.

The net effect then is that for those constructs that need it the pattern
can be grouped correctly to make these sets, that can, for example, be
counted for minCount, even if the set is the empty set.

So that the correct pattern can be generated when looking at values of
values, it is broken up into two parts - one that sets up the stage (usually
determining bindings for ?parent) and one that then sets up bindings for
?this (usually using the bindings for ?parent if it is available).  When
looking at values of values, the outer part is removed, the inner part
becomes the new outer, and a new inner is created to transverse the path.

To this basic context is added several pieces of information that is needed
to generate the SPARQL queries.  This is all available as
  inner - SPARQL pattern or query to get bindings for ?this
  	- usually goes from ?parent to ?this
  outer - SPARQL pattern or query to get bindings for ?parent
  	- not always present, e.g., not present at top level
  severity - the severity to be used in validation results
  projection - the variable used in outer to get to ?this - usually ?parent
  group - how to separate the results for counting, etc.
  	- usually GROUP BY ?parent

	Validation Results

Validation results are solutions in SPARQL result sets.  These result sets
have bindings as follows
 ?this - head node for the result
 ?shape - top-level shape involved in result
 ?message - message for result
 ?severity - severity of result
 ?subject - subject of triple in result
 ?predicate - predicate of triple in result
 ?object - object of triple in result

       Templates

Because prebinding and extension functions are not available to the
implementation it has to use a different method for templates.  The method
used is substitution - instead of prebinding, the template code is subjected
to a process that substitutes the values of parameters into the code.  To
handle subshapes, the method also allows the query for a shape to be
substituted into the code.  

Because there is no functional help like hasShape available the SPARQL
queries need to do include all the mediation for subshapes.  This ends up
with slightly more complex queries than otherwise, but in most cases what is
needed just boilerplate and can be added on to the core portion of the query
by the implementation.  The template mechanism is designed to take care of
this boilerplate.

Substitution normally puts a representation of a node itself into the SPARQL
code.  To get access to larger chunks of the shape graph requires adding a
specifier to the 

Template instantiation proceeds by first augmenting a copy of the context
with argument being the argument of the template, then it looks through
propValues constructs on the template and for any of them that have a
sh:argumentName it augments the context with that name being a value of the
propValues path or the sh:argumentDefault there if there is no value or ""
if the is also no default.  Then it uses this context to substitute in
sh:templateMessage (default "") and adds the result of this for message.
Then it looks for a value for sh:templatePattern and puts that into the
pattern part of a query that will implement the shape.  If there is no
sh:templatePattern then it looks for sh:templateFilter, wraps that in a
negated FILTER, and constructs the shape.

sh:notEqualsT a sh:ComponentTemplate ; rdfs:domain sh:Shape ; rdfs:range rdf:List ;
  sh:list shmm:pathShape ;
  sh:propValues ( ( rdf:rest rdf:rest ) [ sh:hasValue rdf:nil ] ) ;
  sh:propValues ( rdf:first [ sh:shape shmm:pathShape ; sh:argumentName "path1" ] ) ; 
  sh:propValues ( ( rdf:rest rdf:first ) [ sh:shape shmm:pathShape ; sh:argumentName "path2" ] ) ; 
  sh:templateMessage "Path values not disjoint" ;
  sh:messsage "Not list of two paths" ;
  sh:templatePattern """?this [path1:p] ?value1 . ?this [path2:p] ?value1 .""" .
